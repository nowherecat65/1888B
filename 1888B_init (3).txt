Blaine carry the state of New York—and the Presidency—by just 500 votes, the country now gears up for yet another fiercely contested election. President Blaine’s first 4 years in office have been just as contentious as his election. The now-infamous Tariff of 1885, dubbed the “Second Tariff of Abominations” by its southern detractors, polarized the nation as the Republicans stood by their 1884 platform commitment to use the tariff for more than just revenue. While Blaine campaigned in favor of civil service reform, his administration has deliberately slowed it down and continued with some forms of patronage, although he did keep his promise made after the election that he wouldn’t fire any Democrat doing their job well. His tenure also saw the passage of pensions for Union civil war veterans, which has its expected supporters and detractors. The main issues of the day are regarding trade and monetary policy.<p><ul><li>Blaine will make the case that his tariffs are in the best interest of business and labor, as well as trying to keep the Mugwump faction of Republicans disillusioned with the party dragging its feet on civil service reform from jumping ship. He will also advocate strongly for the gold standard.</li><li>Thomas F. Bayard will have to defend his record during the civil war as an apologist towards the Confederacy and a Peace Democrat. He will argue that the Tariff of 1885 must be repealed and that tariffs should be further lowered beyond that. He will attempt to win over the Half-breeds and Mugwumps from the Republicans by pledging to expedite civil service reform and will begin the process of the Democrats warming up to the idea of bimetallism.\n<ul>\n",

Harrison’s reputation for honesty and integrity has earned him respect across party lines.
